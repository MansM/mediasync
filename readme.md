# mediasync

Goal is to be able to sync all watched media between different playing tools like
- plex
- kodi
- etc

## Configuration
In the settings.example.yaml there are some example settings. You can currently set an from zero to an unlimited amount of Plex and Kodi instances.
Just copy it to settings.yaml and configure it for your setup.
For now its just unauthenticated Kodi.

## Help wanted
As I am not a seasoned python developer. Feel free to help out/tell me I do something wrong.
Due to the fact this project is really early in its development, I am still changing some directions while I 
have some brilliant idea (except for the ones I have at 3am and forgot the next morning)
